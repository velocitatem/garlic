| User Sees    | ![user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/velocitatem/garlic/main/media/user.png)             |

# How?
Currently, this is in development, but the beta works like this:

## React

Install the packages with `npm i garlic-react`, you should then import the `Garlic` class with:

```js
import Garlic from 'garlic';
```

You just need to wrap your html in the `garlic()` method:

```js
function App() {
  return Garlic.clove(
          <div className="App">
            <p>Go away robots :)</p>
          </div>
  );
};
```

Go to `index.js` or anywhere before render. Add the following line of code:

```js
Garlic.peal(document);
```

And all is done!

Coming soon :)

## Want some salt with that?
We can also add some [salt](https://auth0.com/blog/adding-salt-to-hashing-a-better-way-to-store-passwords/) to the encoding, add that extra step of security.

# Why?
AI needs data, your website might end-up in the dataset it uses for training. Dont want that? Garlic should help :)
