Garlic is a simple, fast and secure way to protect your website from being scraped by bots.

You write your code and text as you would any other day, just let garlic protect your content from scraping.

|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| You Write    | `<p>This is a test piece of text</p>` |
| Scraper Sees | ![final](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/velocitatem/garlic/main/media/final.png)           |

# Try Now!

1. Go to this website: https://garlic-astro.netlify.app/
2. You will see normal text the way it should be
3. Run the following command: `wget https://garlic-astro.netlify.app/`
4. Open the index.html
5. You will see the encoded text :)



# How?
Currently, this is in development, but the beta works like this:

## React

Install the packages with `npm i garlic-react`, you should then import the `Garlic` class with:

```js
import Garlic from 'garlic';
```

You just need to wrap your html in the `Garlic.clove` method:

```js
function App() {
  return Garlic.clove(
          <div className="App">
            <p>Go away robots :)</p>
          </div>
  );
};
```

Go to `index.js` or anywhere before render. Add the following line of code:

```js
Garlic.peal(document);
```

And all is done!

## Astro

install the package with `npm i garlic-astro`. With Astro, you just need to import the `Garlic` and `Clove` components into your layout:

```astro
import {Garlic, Clove} from 'garlic-astro';
---
<Garlic>
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
      <head>
          <title>{title}</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <Clove>
          <slot />
        </Clove>
      </body>
  </html>
</Garlic>
```

Ideally, `Garlic` should wrap the entire page, and `Clove` should wrap the content you want to protect. You can also use `Clove` multiple times, if you want to protect different parts of your page.

You can then use the layout in `.astro` or `.mdx` files, and the content will be protected.


# Why?
AI needs data, your website might end-up in the dataset it uses for training. Dont want that? Garlic should help :)
