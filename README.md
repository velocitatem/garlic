# Try Now!

1. Go to this website: https://glittery-croquembouche-c25561.netlify.app/
2. You will see normal text the way it should be
3. Run the following command: `wget https://glittery-croquembouche-c25561.netlify.app/`
4. Open the index.html
5. You will see the encoded text :)



# How?
Currently, this is in development, but the beta works like this:

## React

Install the packages with `npm i garlic-react`, you should then import the `Garlic` class with:

```js
import Garlic from 'garlic';
```

You just need to wrap your html in the `garlic()` method:

```js
function App() {
  return Garlic.clove(
          <div className="App">
            <p>Go away robots :)</p>
          </div>
  );
};
```

Go to `index.js` or anywhere before render. Add the following line of code:

```js
Garlic.peal(document);
```

And all is done!
