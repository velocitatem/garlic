Garlic is a simple, fast and secure way to protect your website from being scraped by bots.

## What

You write your code and text as you would any other day, just let garlic protect your content from scraping.

1. You write:

```html
<p>
  This is a test piece of text.
</p>
```

2. The scraper will see:
